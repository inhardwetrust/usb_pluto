1. In DMA stuff - debug registers
2. Started to work after correct Addresses in Address editor - see in addr_editor.png
3. here is corrected axis_gen32 - it supports all sizes.

Speed
This design(software) is "One in flight".
It allows us to have 
260.149 Mbit/s  (32.519 MB/s)  |     992.4 pkt/s 
Thi is maximum for USB. More packet size doesn't help.
